                <p>Vito Corleone (born Vito Andolini) is a fictional character in Mario Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather
                    and in the first two of Francis Ford Coppola's film trilogy. Vito is originally portrayed by Marlon
                    Brando in the 1972 film The Godfather, and later by Oreste Baldini as a boy and by Robert De Niro as
                    a young man in The Godfather Part II (1974). He is an orphaned Sicilian immigrant who builds a Mafia
                    empire.

                    He and his wife Carmela have four children: Santino ("Sonny"), Frederico ("Fredo"), and Michael
                    ("Mike"), and one daughter Constanzia ("Connie"). Vito informally adopts Sonny's friend, Tom Hagen,
                    who becomes his lawyer and consigliere. Upon Vito's death, Michael succeeds him as Don of the
                    Corleone crime family.

                    Vito oversees a business founded on gambling, bootlegging, prostitution, and union corruption, but
                    he is known as a kind, generous man who lives by a strict moral code of loyalty to friends and,
                    above all, family. He is also known as a traditionalist who demands respect commensurate with his
                    status; even his closest friends refer to him as "Godfather" or "Don Corleone" rather than "Vito".
